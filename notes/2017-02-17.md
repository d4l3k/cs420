# Linear Programming Duality

max $x_1+6x_2$

subject to $x_1\leq 200$, $x_2\leq 300$
... (same thing as last time)

## Duality Theorem
If LP has a bounded optimum then so does its dual and the two optimum values are
the same.

## Primal

$I=\{1,2,\ldots,m\}$

$N=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$

$max c_1 x_1 + \ldots + c_n x_n$

such that $a_{i1}x_1 + \ldots + a_{in}x_n \leq b_i for i\in I$

$a_{i1}x_1 + \ldots + a_{in}x_n = b_i for i\not\in I$

$x_j \geq 0 for j\in N$

## Dual

Min $b_1y_1+\ldots+b_m y_m$

such that $a_{j1}x_1 + \ldots + a_{jm}x_m \geq c_j for j\in N$

$a_{j1}x_1 + \ldots + a_{jn}x_n = c_j for j\not\in N$

$y_i\geq 0 for i\in I$

# Two Player Zero-Sum Games

## Rock paper scissors
|          | rock | paper | scissors |
|----------|------|-------|----------|
| rock     |    0 |    -1 |        1 |
| paper    |    1 |     0 |       -1 |
| scissors |   -1 |     1 |        0 |

If Row plays "rock" then Col can win every time.

A mixed strategy is a probability distribution on the actions.
