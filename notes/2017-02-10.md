# Open Pit Mining


Input: Directed acyclic graph $G=(V,E)$ where V = set of tasks.

$E = \{ (u, v) | u\text{ must be done before v} \}$.

a function w(v) that specifies profit from the task.

Find the most profitable set of tasks to perform.

An initial set in a set of vertices that has no edge coming into it from the
outside.

Convert problem to a newtork flow problem so that
1. any infinite capacity cut corresponds to an initial set and ,
2. a minimum capacity cut corresponds to max profit initial set.

If we connect all the nodes with infinite capacity, and then reverse it, we get
finite capacities.

Claim: In this "network", any finite capacity cut (S,T) defines an initial set
T-{t}.

Proof: If cut(S,T) has finite capacity then no original edge is directed into T
from S. THus T-{t} is an initial set.

If set U is an initial set, then  $T=U\cup\{t\}, S=V-T$ is a cut with no
original edge entering T thus finite capacity.
