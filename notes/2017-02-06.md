# Applications of Network Flows

## Max matching in Bipartite Graphs

Claim:

1. If M is a matching in G then there exists flow f in F (flow network from G)
   such that size(f) = |M|. $size(f*) \geq |M*|$
2. If f is an integer valued flow in F, then there exists a matching M in G of
   size size(f). $size(f*) \leq |M*|$.


Let $M = \{ (u,v) \in G | f(u,v) = 1 \}$
M forms a matching. Why? (capacities of edges from s are 1 and from t are 1.


## Pennant Race Problem

Given a team A, a list of other teams $T_1,T_2,\ldots,T_n$, win-loss record for
each team, and list of games remaining to be played.

Determine if it is possible for team A to win at least as many games as any
other team by the end of the season.

Output is yes/no.

|     | Wins |
| --- | ---- |
|A|3|
|$T_1$|4|
|$T_2$|6|
|$T_3$|5|
|$T_4$|4|

Remaining games: (A, T1) (T1, T2) (T2, T3) (A, T3) (T2, T4) (A, T4) (T1, T2)

We can remove all games that A plays since we can say that A wins all of them.

Assume team A wins all remaining games.
Let w = # A's wins (after A wins all remaining games).
Let $w_i$ = # wins of $T_i$.

If $w < w_i$ for some i then A has no hope.

### Greedy Approach

Doesn't work. Can't just do an O(n) summation or anything similar.

# Runtime of Ford-Fulkerson

Bipartite matching $O(|V|*|E|)$.

There's a more modern and faster way of doing this, but way more complicated.
From 2012. That lets you calculate the network flow in a flow network with V
vertices and E edges, $O(|V|*|E|)$.
