# Pennant Race Problem

w = #A's wins (assuming A wins all remaining games)

$w_i$ = #$T_i$'s wins

$\{(T_i, T_j)\}$ = games remaining to be played

If $w_i > w$ then no hope for A. Done.

So assume $W_i\leq w$ for all i.

Can draw a flow graph with s pointing to each game, and each game pointing to
the two participating teams, and the teams pointing to t..

Edges:

$(s, (T_i, T_j))$ with capacity 1

$((T_i, T_j), T_i), ((T_i, T_j), T_j)$ with capacity 1

$(T_i, t)$ with capacity $w_i-w$.


If max flow size = # games to play, then A still has hope.


Runtime $O((\#games*3 + \#teams) * (\#games + \#teams))$.
