### Online Algorithms

* Paging
* k-server
* (online coloring, not on exam)

Examples of competitive analysis, compete to something stronger and then show
how closely you are. Can't differentiate using standard analysis. Close to
optimal for all inputs.

* Randomized Marking Mouse $O(\log m)$-competitive

### Hashing

* Universal set of hash functions
* Cuckoo Hashing
* Analysing properties of Cuckoo graphs
