# Cuckoo Graph

Cycles are dangerous. Want to know how long the chains are.

n elements hashed

Lemma: For c>1 and $m\geq 2cn$,
probability cuckoo graph contains a shortest path of length $l\geq 1$ between
vertices i, and j is $\leq \frac{1}{mc^l}$.

(Assume $h_1(A)$ and $h_2(A)$ are random, uniform table slots).

Proof: by induction on $l$

Base $l=1$ Edge $(i,j)$ exists in graph with prob
$\leq n \frac{2}{m^2} = \frac{1}{c*m}$


For $l>1$ shorted path from i to j has length l only i fthere exists p and

1. There exists a shorted pat from i to p of length l-1 (occurs with probability $\leq \frac{1}{m*c^{l-1}}$).
2. and, there exists the edge (p,j) (occurs with prob $\leq \frac{1}{mc}$).

These two together occur with probability, $\leq \frac{1}{m^2*c^{l}}$

Sum over possible nodes $p\to n \leq \frac{ml}{m^2c^l}$


Propability that k and k' hash to the same path ("bucket") of cuckoo graph is
probability of a path from h1(k) or h2(k) to h1(k') or h2(k')

$\leq 4\sum_{l=1}^\infty \frac[ 1{mc^l} = \frac4m \frac1{c-1}=O(\frac 1m)$.

Rehash means choose new hash functions and rehash all keys.

Probability rehash occurs:

* $\leq$ probility hashing creates cuckoo graph with a cycle

* $\leq \sum_{i=1}^m Pr[cycle involivng i]$

* $\leq \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{l=1}^\infty \frac{1}{mc^l} \leq \frac12$ for $c\geq 3$.


Expected number of rehashes is $\leq 2$.
