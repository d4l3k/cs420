# Witness

$\phi = (x \vee y \vee z) (\bar x \vee \bar y) (x \vee \bar z)$
<- Conjuntive normal form

$\phi \in SAT \equiv \phi$ has a satisfying truth assignment

Witness is a truth statement.

If it's satisfiable, there has to be a witness.

$\phi \in Co-Sat \equiv \phi$ has no satisfying assignment iff $\phi \in SAT$.

# NP-Completeness

L is NP-complete $\equiv$ L is in NP and L is NP-hard.

NP $\equiv \exists$ witness

CoNP $\equiv \forall$ witnesses

$\exists x \forall y$ verifyable in poly time $\equiv \sum_z$

$\forall x \exists y = \Pi_z$

## Proofing

You can do a transfer proof, by showing that a NP-foo problem can be transformed
into whatever problem, thus it must have an lower limit of NP-foo.

# True Quantified Boolean Formulas

$\forall x \exists y \forall z (x \vee y \vee z) (\bar x \vee \bar y)$

# Approximation Algorithms

You can make an approximation to an NP problem in P time. This can have provable
performance limits. Heuristics however, don't have any guarantees.

An algorithm A is a $\rho$-approximation algorithm if for every input I with
optimal solution value $OPT(I)$.
