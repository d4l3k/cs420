# Hardness of Approximation

The general TSP is NP-hard to approximate.

## Claim

If $P\neq NP$ then, there is no polytime c-approximation algorithm for TSP.


## Proof
Suppose A is a poly time c-approximation algorithm for TSP. We use A to solve
Hamiltonian Cycle.

Black box, reduction: Hamiltonian Cycle

G -> [ -> X -> (G') -> A -> Y -> ] -> Y/N

Transform X: Create G' from G. G' has all edges

$$w(u,v) = \{1 if (u,v) \in G, c|V|+1 if (u,v)\not \in G\}$$


Transform Y: If $|TSP_A(G')| \leq c|V|$ then output yes, otherwise no.

## Why does this work?

Edges not in the original graph are so costly that there is a gap between cost
of tour if G contains a Hamiltonian cycle (cost=n), otherwise if G doesn't
contain it the cost has to be greater than $c|V|$.
