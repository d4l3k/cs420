# Question 6

The set Z has n-m connected components where m is the number of elements that
are duplicated. Since this is a set of discrete numbers, those which are the
same are connected, where those that aren't are part of disjoint sets. Thus the
number of connected components is just the number of distinct elements in the
set.
