The fraction of oil to vinegar in the oil jar is equal to the fraction of
vinegar to oil in the vinegar jar. This happens since the total volume of both
is equal since you're transferring the exact same amount of liquid between the
jars.

$$ vol_1 = vol_2 $$
$$ vol_{oil} = 1 $$
$$ vol_{vinegar} = 1 $$

If there is some $v$ amount of oil in the vinegar jar, for the volumes to be the
same, there must also be some $v$ amount of vinegar in the oil jar.
