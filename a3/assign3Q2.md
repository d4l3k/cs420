# Question 2

![](./q2.svg.png)\


We can see that this algorithm does not compute a maximum flow for the network
above labeled #1. There are several possible flows that this could calculate. The
flow #2 above, is the maximal flow for this graph with a capacity of 10. The
second flow #3 is suboptimal but could be selected by this greedy algorithm if
it arbitrarily picked a path that took the central edge, thus limiting the
maximum flow.
